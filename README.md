* [General Info](# MLR Model to solve a business problem in identifying the factors to predict rental bikes demand)
* [Technologies Used](# Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Statsmodel, )
* [Conclusions](# We have identified 9 independent variables from the dataset to predict bike sales with a significant accuracy)

## General Information
Linear Regression Model to find the impact of independent variables to predict the count of bikes rented. 
This model can predict the target variable if values of all independent values are known. This model can be used by business in forecasting demand and prepare ahead of season.
Business can also use this model while planning to expand in new markets.



## Conclusions
- if atemp increases then bike demand increases
- If there is increase in LightRain(this variable was derived from weathersit) then bike demand decreases. 
- Year has a positive coefficient meaning demand is increasing with each passing year.
- If there is increase in Windspeed then bike demand decreases.
